# Simulate gene expression evolution in a fitness landscape as Levy Flights

Parts of this project were done by my (AOM) student, Tomasz Nałęcz. The earlier stages of the project, done by me, are in this branch ([aom](https://github.com/anuszka/fitnesslandscapestudent/tree/aom)). The later stages are in the branch [master](https://github.com/anuszka/fitnesslandscapestudent/).
